1. PS2EXE (https://github.com/MScholtes/PS2EXE)
   Copyright (c) Markus Scholtes
   The original PowerShell to executable converter

2. PowerChell (https://github.com/scrt/PowerChell)
   Alternative PowerShell executable implementation

3. "Reinventing PowerShell" (https://itm4n.github.io/reinventing-powershell/)
   Technical article by itm4n providing deep insights into PowerShell executable internals

4. PrivescCheck (https://github.com/itm4n/PrivescCheck)
