Welcome to PowerShell Executor Builder Test Application!

This is a sample text file that demonstrates how the PowerShell Executor Builder can embed text resources into executable files.

Features demonstrated:
✓ Text file reading from embedded resources
✓ Image display from embedded resources
✓ Modern WPF GUI interface
✓ Resource path detection (script dir, working dir, temp dir)
✓ Error handling for missing files

When this PowerShell script is converted to an executable using PSEBuilder:
1. This text file (test.txt) will be embedded as a base64-encoded resource
2. The image file (image.png) will also be embedded
3. At runtime, resources are extracted to temp directory
4. The application can access them seamlessly

This demonstrates the power of the PowerShell Executor Builder system for creating
self-contained executable applications with embedded resources.

Test Information:
- Script: test-gui-app.ps1
- Text Resource: test.txt (this file)
- Image Resource: image.png
- Build System: PSEBuilder.ps1
- GUI Framework: WPF/XAML

Thank you for testing the PowerShell Executor Builder!
